    "Hi, I am Rudra, an AI and ML engineer who loves turning complex data into systems that actually work in the real world. I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence Systems at the University of Florida, building on hands-on industry experience in ML pipelines, computer vision, and generative AI. I have worked on production-level projects spanning Healthcare AI, Generative AI and LLMs, People Analytics, Time Series Forecasting, Customer Analytics, and MLOps.",
    "From building multi-agent RAG pipelines and constructing an LLM from scratch, to deploying a CNN model that classified diabetic retinopathy across 35,000 plus retinal images with 96% accuracy, I am always working at the edge of what I know. I care as much about responsible AI as I do about performance, which is why explainability and fairness evaluation are always part of how I build. I am actively looking for roles in AI and ML engineering, data science, and applied research where I can build things that matter."
